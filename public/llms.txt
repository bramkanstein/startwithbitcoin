## Common Questions

**What is Nostr?**
Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is a decentralized protocol
for identity and messaging. Each identity is a cryptographic keypair.

**What is NWC?**
Nostr Wallet Connect is a protocol that lets applications control Lightning
wallets remotely using Nostr messages.

**What is Lightning?**
Lightning Network is Bitcoin's Layer 2 for instant, cheap payments.
Perfect for AI agent microtransactions.

**How do agents pay each other?**
Agents create Lightning invoices using NWC, share them via Nostr DMs,
and pay each other instantly.
